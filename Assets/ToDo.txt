Make 2 cameras: one for 1st person view and the other for 3rd person. The 3rd person one is already done,
but for the 1st person, I'll need to adjust the camera rotation according to the player.

Improve state of the game after depleting all health. Now the car keeps moving after death.
Maybe make him really stop or just make a death screen.

Create the rest of the circuit and implement weapons.

Implement a car change system, maybe with occasional pit stops. Don't forget to put player tag
on whichever vehicle the player is running on, and REMEMBER to put enemy tag on enemy vehicles.
By the way, add enemy vehicle generation.

Do damage based on rigidbody velocity variation. If it varies too much, probably the player hit
something or jumped too high, which means it should take damage.

Add friction to different terrain, like grass and road.

Make the walls repeat the texture or materials, idk.

Add speed meter and maybe some related things.

Add ways to get more life, to make the game more lasting.

Make a score system.

Add menus to enter, to quit the game etc.

Work on the map.
